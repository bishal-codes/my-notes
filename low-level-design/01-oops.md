## Roadmap to LLD (Low Level Designing)

1.  Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:
    `Object-Oriented Programming is about modelling a system as a collection of objects where each object represents a particular aspect of the system. Objects contain both functions (methods) and data (attributes). An objects provides a public interface to other code that wants to use it but maintains its private, internal state; other parts of the system don't have to care about what is going on inside an object.`

    - fundamental paradigm for designing low-level systems
    - mastery of OOPs forms foundation for `building robust/efficient, scalable, and maintainable systems`.
    - user requirements

## Applications of OOPs

- `User interface design` such as windows and menus (encapsulation and abstraction): a system that allows users to interact with a computer or software application. e.g. web applications, mobile applications, etc.
- `Real time systems`(timeliness and time synchronization): any information processing system with hardware and software components that perform real-time application functions and can respond to events within predictable and specific time constraints. e.g. air traffic control systems, industrial control systems, robotics, etc.
- `client-server systems` (scalability and maintainability): a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. e.g. web applications, database management systems, etc.
- `hypertext and hypermedia systems` (linking and navigation): a system that allows users to create and follow references between multimedia documents, including text, images, audio, and video. e.g. web browsers, e-books, etc.
- `object-oriented database` (data modeling and management): a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. e.g. MongoDB, object-oriented databases, object-relational databases, etc.
- `Neural networks and parallel programming` (modularity and reusability): a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system, designed to recognize patterns. e.g. artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.
- `AI expert systems` (knowledge representation and reasoning): a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. e.g. medical diagnosis, financial planning, etc.
- `Simulation and Modeling System` (abstraction and encapsulation): a computer system that models the behavior of a real-world system or process. e.g. flight simulators, weather forecasting, etc.
- `Office Automation Systems` (inheritance and polymorphism): a computer system that automates office operations and procedures. e.g. word processing, spreadsheets, etc.
- `CIM(Computer Integrated Manufacturing)/CAD(Computer-Aided Design)/CAM(Computer-Aided Manufacturing)` (inheritance and polymorphism): a computer system that integrates manufacturing operations and procedures. e.g. computer-aided design, computer-aided manufacturing, etc.
- `Computer-Aided Design (CAD)` (inheritance and polymorphism): a computer system that assists in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. e.g. architectural design, engineering design, etc.
