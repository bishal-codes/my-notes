## UML Diagrams

- a general-purpose model that describes the behavior of a system
- a graphical representation of a system
- a visual representation of a system (standard way to visualize a system)
- is not a programming language but a visual representation of a system

## Why UML Diagrams?

- can be used in communication purpose to have a clear and concise description of a complex system
- communication between stakeholders, non-programmers about the essential requirements, functionalities and processes of a system

## Types of UML Diagrams

1. Structural diagrams

   - Class Diagram: building block of all object-oriented software systems

     - use to depict the static structure of system (classes, attributes, operations, relationships)
     - helps to identify the relationship between classes, objects, and their attributes

   - Composite structure diagram: shows the internal structure of a class and its interaction points with other classes

   - Object Diagram: shows a complete or partial view of the structure of a modeled system at a specific time

     - shows the instances of classes in the system and the relationships between them

   - Component Diagram: shows the organization and dependencies among software components

     - shows the physical components of a system

   - Deployment Diagram: shows the configuration of run-time processing nodes and the components that live on them

     - shows the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes

   - Package Diagram: shows the organization and dependencies among packages
     - shows the organization of the model elements into packages

2. Behavioral UML Diagrams

- State Machine Diagram: shows the states of an object and the transitions between those states

  - shows the dynamic behavior of an object

- Activity Diagram: shows the flow from one activity to another

  - shows the flow of control from activity to activity

- Use Case Diagram: shows the interaction between the system and external entities

  - shows the interaction between the system and external entities

- Sequence Diagram: shows the sequence of messages exchanged between objects

  - shows the sequence of messages exchanged between objects

- Communication Diagram: shows the interactions between objects

  - shows the interactions between objects

- Timing Diagram: shows the timing constraints between the objects
  - shows the timing constraints between the objects

## OOPs in UML Diagrams

1. class: a blueprint for creating objects
2. object: an instance of a class
3. inheritance: a mechanism where a new class inherits properties from an existing class
4. polymorphism: a mechanism that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions
5. encapsulation: a mechanism that binds the data and the functions that manipulate the data
6. abstraction: a mechanism that hides the implementation details and shows only the functionality

- software development methodologies like Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, etc. use UML diagrams to visualize the system

## Tools for UML Diagrams

- Visual Paradigm
- Lucidchart
- draw.io

## Steps to Create UML Diagrams

1. Identify the purpose of the diagram
2. Identify the elements and their relationships
3. Select the appropriate diagram type
4. Create the rough draft
5. Choose a UML Modeling Tool (Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart, draw.io)
6. Create the final draft
7. Review the diagram
8. Generate documentation
9. Update the diagram as needed
10. Share the diagram with stakeholders

## Best practices for UML Diagrams

- Use consistent notation
- Use the right diagram for the right purpose
- Use the right level of detail
- Use color coding to differentiate elements
- Use a consistent layout
- understand the audience
