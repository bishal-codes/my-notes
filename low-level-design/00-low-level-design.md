# Low Level Design LLD in System Design

- object-level designing or micro-level designing or detailed designing.
- component level design process that follows step by step refinement process. the input to LLd is the HLD and the output is the detailed design of the system.
- The main goal of the low-level design is to specify how each and every module of the requirement specification will be implemented.
- involves converting the high-level design into a more detailed blueprint, addressing specific algorithms, data structures, and interfaces.
- serves as a guide for developers during coding, ensuring the accurate and efficient implementation of the systemâ€™s functionality.
- describes class diagrams with the help of methods and relations between classes and program specs.

## Difference between HLD and LLD

- general system design where the system is broken down into smaller components and modules.
- here according to the business needs, and how system should work (in both functional and non-functional ways), the different frameworks, languages, and technologies, components and different databases are considered.
  - selection of components, platforms, frameworks, and technologies.
  - database design.
  - brief description of relationships between services and modules.

## How to form LLD from HLD

- input to LLD is HLD.
- in LLD, the main goal is to specify how components look like, the structure possessed by different entities, and how different entities (modules) will have their responsibilities(operations supported by them).
  - `Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams`
  - `OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts`
  - `SOLID` (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) principles
