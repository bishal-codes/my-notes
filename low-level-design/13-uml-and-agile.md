## UML and Agile Development

- Agile development is a software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration

1. UML in Agile Development

- visualization and communication of the system
- User stories and use cases
- iteration planning (meaning the development process is broken down into smaller iterations)
- agile modeling techniques (such as CRC cards, user stories, and use cases)

2. Balancing UML and Agile

- adaptive modeling (approach to modeling that is based on the idea that the model should be just enough to meet the needs of the project)
- team empowerment (empower the development team to make decisions about the design and implementation of the system)
