## Design Patterns

- `Design patterns` are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are templates that can be applied to different situations to solve similar problems. Design patterns help streamline the development process, promote code reuse, and enhance the overall quality of software systems.

## Why Design Patterns?

- speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
- are programming language-independent strategies for solving common object-oriented design problems.
- represents an idea not a particular implementation. (make code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable)
- are meant for common problem solving and not for project development.

## Importance of Design Patterns

- `Problem-solution Approach`: identify common problems and provide proven solutions.
- `abstraction`: abstract the complexity of the system and focus on the key aspects or high-level design concepts.
- `proven solutions`: design patterns are tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design.
- `Code Reusability`: Design patterns promote code reuse by providing proven solutions to common problems.
- `Scalability`: Design patterns help in building scalable systems that can handle increased loads and user requests.
- `Maintainability`: Design patterns improve the maintainability of software systems by providing a clear structure and organization.
- `Communication or common vocabulary`: Design patterns provide a common language and vocabulary for developers to communicate and collaborate effectively.

## Types of Design Patterns

- `Creational Design Patterns`
- `Structural Design Patterns`
- `Behavioral Design Patterns`:

5.  SOLID Principles

- `Step 1`: Understand the requirements and constraints.
- `Step 2`: Define the class diagram.
- `Step 3`: Define the relationship between classes.
- `Step 4`: Define the methods and attributes of classes.
- `Step 5`: Define the data structures.
- `Step 6`: Define the algorithms.
- `Step 7`: Define the interfaces.
- `Step 8`: Define the database schema.
