## React Router

- a library for routing in React applications. It allows you to create different routes for different components or views in your application, enabling navigation between those views based on the current URL. It helps in building single-page applications where the content dynamically changes without refreshing the entire page.

In simple terms, React Router provides a way to map URLs to specific components, allowing users to navigate through different pages or sections within your React application. It ensures that the UI updates and renders the appropriate components based on the current URL, giving a seamless and intuitive user experience similar to traditional multi-page websites.
