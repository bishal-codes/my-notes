## React-Router-Dom

React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. react-router-dom is a specific package within React Router that provides DOM bindings for React Router. It includes components and utilities specifically designed for web applications.

react-router-dom extends the capabilities of React Router by providing additional components such as BrowserRouter, HashRouter, Route, Switch, Link, and NavLink. These components enable you to define routes, handle navigation, and render the appropriate components based on the current URL.

BrowserRouter and HashRouter are the two main types of routers provided by react-router-dom. BrowserRouter uses the HTML5 history API for navigation, while HashRouter uses the URL hash to manage routing. The Route component is used to define individual routes and specify the component to render when a specific route is matched. Switch is used to render only the first matching route, and Link and NavLink components are used to create links and navigation elements in your application.

In summary, react-router-dom is a package within React Router that offers DOM-specific components and utilities for implementing routing in web applications built with React.
