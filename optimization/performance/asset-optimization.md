Asset optimization in frontend ðŸ’¡

Asset optimization helps in reducing the webapp load time, reducing server cost, reduce browser incompatibilities and so on.

Here a few steps to optimize images, videos, fonts , javascript and css on your webapps.

ðŸ‘‰ Compression - We can compress the size of our assets using various online tools or use optimized versions of them like img/avif, img/webp , video/webm.

ðŸ‘‰ Adaptive Media Loading - We can load the assets on the basis of the network connection. For ex - loading smaller images on slower n/w and videos on fast n/w.

ðŸ‘‰ Lazy Loading - Lazy loading assets will help in loading them only when they are in the viewport.

ðŸ‘‰ Subset Fonts - Many fonts can be a subset or even split into multiple Unicode ranges to deliver only the characters needed for a particular page.
By using @font-face, we can use the Unicode range descriptor to specify a list of range values.

ðŸ‘‰ Asynchronously load JS/CSS - Third-party scripts should always be loaded asynchronously unless they are required to run before the page can be rendered.

ðŸ‘‰ Preloading WebFonts - Using font-display to control how browsers behave with unavailable fonts, we can prevent blank pages and layout shifts due to font loading.

ðŸ‘‰ Minify CSS/JS - Minifying CSS and JS files will help in reducing the file size and hence the load time.

ðŸ‘‰ Tree Shaking - Tree shaking is a process that removes unused code from the final bundle. It helps in reducing the bundle size and hence the load time.

ðŸ‘‰ Code Splitting - Code splitting is a technique used to split the code into smaller bundles which can be loaded on demand or in parallel.

ðŸ‘‰ Image Optimization - Image optimization is the process of reducing the file size of an image without affecting its quality. This can be done by using various tools like ImageOptim, ImageAlpha, ImageMagick, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ Video Optimization - Video optimization is the process of reducing the file size of a video without affecting its quality. This can be done by using various tools like HandBrake, FFmpeg, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ Font Optimization - Font optimization is the process of reducing the file size of a font without affecting its quality. This can be done by using various tools like FontForge, FontSquirrel, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ JavaScript Optimization - JavaScript optimization is the process of reducing the file size of a JavaScript file without affecting its functionality. This can be done by using various tools like UglifyJS, Closure Compiler, etc.

Asset Optimization in Backend ðŸ’¡

Asset optimization in backend is a process of optimizing the assets like images, videos, fonts, javascript and css on the server side before serving them to the client.

Here are a few steps to optimize assets on the server side:

ðŸ‘‰ Compression - We can compress the size of our assets using various tools like gzip, brotli, etc.

ðŸ‘‰ Caching - We can cache the assets on the server side to reduce the load time for subsequent requests.

ðŸ‘‰ Minification - We can minify the assets like CSS, JS, etc. to reduce the file size and hence the load time.
