# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- `Red` - Write a failing test
- `Green` - Write the minimum amount of code to pass the test
- `Refactor` - Refactor the code to make it clean and maintainable, without changing its functionality.

- `write test cases before writing the actual code`
- `software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle`
- `requirements are turned into very specific test cases`

## Benefits

- `improves the quality of the code`
- `reduces the time required for project development`
- `reduces the number of bugs in the code`
- `helps developers understand what is needed to be done`
