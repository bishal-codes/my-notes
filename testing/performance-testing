# Performance Testing

## For Frontend application

- page speed (fast loading website): page load time
- seo (search engine optimization)
- accessibility (web content accessible to all users)
- responsive design (works well on different devices)
- bounce rate

## For Backend application

- response time
- throughput
- resource utilization
- scalability
- reliability
- fault tolerance
- latency

## Performance Testing Tools

- developer console (browser)
- lighthouse (chrome extension) - audits for performance, seo, accessibility, best practices
- page speed insights (google)
- webpagetest.org - tests from various locations around the world

Timings in performance:

- DCL (DOMContentLoaded): HTML is loaded and parsed
- LCP (Largest Contentful Paint): time taken to render the largest content element
- FCP (First Contentful Paint): time taken to render the first content element
- TTI (Time to Interactive): time taken to make the page interactive
- FP (First Paint): time taken to render the first pixel
