# Security Testing in Software Testing and Development

- `performed to identify the vulnerabilities of the system and to ensure that the data is not exposed to unauthorized users`
- ensures that the software is free from any security risks

## Tool for Security Testing

- `OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)`
- `Burp Suite`
- `Netsparker`
- `Acunetix`
- `Nmap`
- `Metasploit`
- `Wireshark`

Burp Suite works as a proxy server (middleware) between the browser and the internet. It intercepts the traffic and allows you to inspect and modify the requests and responses.- `Snort IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System)`
