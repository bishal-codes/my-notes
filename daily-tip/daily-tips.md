# Tip 1

If you're a fresher / job seeker who's looking to start a personal project, here's a pro tip - search "production ready template" on Github for whatever you're trying to build.

Use the template to learn about how software engineers actually build applications in the real world.

Trying to build a backend API with NodeJS? Google "production ready nodejs backend template"

Replace the "nodejs backend" with whatever you need.

Some things you can do to learn:
• Observe the folder structure, how the files are organized
• Observe the coding patterns, how functions, classes, code and logic is organized
• Check the project dependencies (e.g. package.json, requirements.txt etc), look up what each one does

These days we don't really start new projects from scratch, we all have some templates that we use to get started. For freshers, using a 'production ready' template will be both good for their resume, and also to learn about what we actually do in the industry.

# Tip 2 

How to break into tech:

Old way:
- Spend 6-figures on a 4 year degree
- Land internship(s) to gain experience
- Rely on the school's network.
- Binge Leetcode and hope for an interview

New way:
- Curate your own curriculum for free
- Contribute to open source projects
- Build something that interests you
- Go to meetups and engage on LinkedIn

Direct ownership > expensive reliance.
