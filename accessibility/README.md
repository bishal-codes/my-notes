# Accessibility in Web Development

1. What is Accessibility?

- Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

## Disabilities that Affect Web Accessibility

- There are many different types of disabilities that can affect web accessibility. Some of the most common include:

  - Visual impairments: People who are blind, have low vision, or are colorblind.
  - Motor impairments: People with conditions that affect their ability to use a mouse or keyboard.
  - Auditory impairments: People who are deaf or hard of hearing.
  - Cognitive impairments: People with conditions that affect their ability to understand information or navigate a website.
  - neurological impairments: People with conditions that affect their ability to use a computer or navigate a website.
  - Speech impairments: People who have difficulty speaking or communicating.
  - Situational impairments: People who may have temporary disabilities, such as a broken arm, or who are using a device in a challenging environment, such as bright sunlight.

2. Why is Accessibility Important?

- The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as older people, people in rural areas, and people in developing countries.

3. Assistive Technologies

- Assistive technologies are specialized software and hardware tools that help people with disabilities use computers and the Internet. Some examples include screen readers, screen magnifiers, speech recognition programs, alternative input devices, refreshable braille displays, and specialized keyboards.

4. Web Accessibility Standards

- WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)

  - [LEVEL A](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist): The most basic web accessibility features.
  - [LEVEL AA](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist): Deals with the biggest and most common barriers for disabled users.
  - [LEVEL AAA](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist): The highest (and most complex) level of web accessibility.

- The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are part of a series of web accessibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main international standards organization for the Internet. They are a set of guidelines that specify how to make content accessible, primarily for people with disabilitiesâ€”but also for all user agents, including highly limited devices, such as mobile phones.

  - Perceivable: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
  - Operable: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
  - Understandable: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
  - Robust: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

5. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Roles

- ARIA defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA roles are used to define the type of user interface element that is being used.

6. Screen Readers

- Screen readers are software programs that allow blind or visually impaired users to read the text that is displayed on the computer screen with a speech synthesizer or braille display. A screen reader is the interface between the computer's operating system, its applications, and the user.

7. Focus Management

- Focus management is the practice of making sure that the keyboard focus is always visible and that the user knows where they are on the page. This is especially important for users who rely on the keyboard for navigation.

8. Contrast Ratios Themes

- The contrast ratio between text (or images of text) and background is a key aspect of how people perceive the content. The contrast ratio is a measure of the relative luminance between the text (or image of text) and the background. The contrast ratio is calculated using the formula (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), where L1 is the relative luminance of the lighter of the colors, and L2 is the relative luminance of the darker of the colors.

9. [Tooling for Accessibility](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/)

- There are many tools available to help you test the accessibility of your website. Some of the most popular tools include the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool, the Axe Accessibility Testing Engine, and the Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools.
