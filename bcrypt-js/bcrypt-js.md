## bcrypt.js

1. Description: bcrypt.js is a JavaScript library for hashing passwords using the bcrypt algorithm. It is optimized for JavaScript and is compatible with both Node.js and browsers. It offers a secure way to hash passwords, incorporating a salt to protect against rainbow table attacks and providing adaptive features to resist brute-force search attacks.

2. Security Considerations: bcrypt.js is designed to enhance security by making it difficult for attackers to crack hashed passwords. It uses adaptive iterations to slow down the hashing process, making it resistant to brute-force attacks even with increasing computational power. The library is not as fast as the C++ bcrypt binding but is still secure.

3. Installation: You can install bcrypt.js using npm:

```bash
$ npm install bcryptjs
```

4. Usage:

In Node.js:
```javascript
var bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
```

In browsers:
```javascript
var bcrypt = dcodeIO.bcrypt;
```

5. Generating Hashes:

- Synchronous:
```javascript
var salt = bcrypt.genSaltSync(10);
var hash = bcrypt.hashSync("B4c0/\/", salt);
```

- Asynchronous:
```javascript
bcrypt.genSalt(10, function(err, salt) {
    bcrypt.hash("B4c0/\/", salt, function(err, hash) {
        // Store hash in your password DB.
    });
});
```

6. Auto-generating a salt and hash:
```javascript
var hash = bcrypt.hashSync('bacon', 8);
```

7. Comparing Passwords:

- Synchronous:
```javascript
bcrypt.compareSync("B4c0/\/", hash); // true
bcrypt.compareSync("not_bacon", hash); // false
```

- Asynchronous:
```javascript
bcrypt.compare("B4c0/\/", hash, function(err, res) {
    // res === true
});
```

8. API: The library provides functions for generating and comparing hashes, getting the number of rounds used, and extracting the salt from a hash. See the full API details in the documentation.

9. Security Tips:

- Use HTTPS when sending data to secure the transmission.
- Carefully validate inputs to prevent malicious data.
- Protect against SQL injection when dealing with databases.
- Beware of XSS attacks and sanitize user inputs.
- Limit access to server-side scripts and databases.
- Implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to control access.
- Keep server software updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Stay informed about the latest security threats.
