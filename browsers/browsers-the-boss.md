▶︎ Who’s the boss? The mighty browser! 

▶︎ Frontend Engineering is not only about learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

▶︎▶︎ As developers who get most of the things for free, i.e., memory management, garbage collection, event handlers and what not; we tend to forget that who actually provides us those things. 
Browsers are the desktop applications which help us to interact with its engine(Environment) and the Operating System with some pretty basic commands plus its good old definition - use HTTP to make requests to web servers through the internet on behalf of you.

▶︎ Don’t believe me?

▶︎▶︎ Where your mighty JS bundles execute? Where your huge objects of redux get stored? Browsers.

▶︎▶︎ How you fetch your APIs, etc. and communicate with your server? Browsers. 

▶︎▶︎ How you can run JavaScript and run the web application on the local to see the changes you’ll see on serving a web application? Browsers. 

▶︎▶︎ Who provides with the great APIs to communicate with a rich runtime environment? Browsers. 

▶︎▶︎ Who lets you debug the network request and help you with the HTTP and tells you the stalling and queueing period of a HTTP request? Browsers. 

▶︎▶︎ Who provide you with an interface to render HTML and show something visible on the screen? Browsers.

▶︎▶︎ From Drag Events of web application to message queue(async await) of operating system, Browsers help us to deal with most of the complex problems with our JavaScript code.

▶︎ Browsers are an intuitive interface to interact with the operating system. 
Understanding how they work, understanding how they might lag the web application(on infinite scroll etc), will help you to become a great Frontend Engineer.
